# Birthday Hacking Interface üéâüéÇ

This project is a fun and creative way to wish your friend a happy birthday with a "hacking" theme. It displays a retro-style hacking interface that transitions to a heartfelt birthday message in Marathi (or any language of your choice). The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create this interactive experience.

## Features
1. **Hacking Interface**:
